Q4.List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.
Answer:- 
Use semantic Tag :Semantic HTML elements are essential for enhancing accessibility as they offer meaningful structure to content. Elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, and <footer> communicate the purpose of various sections to assistive technologies, enabling users with disabilities to navigate and comprehend the content more effectively.

Provide Alt Text for images: Alt text for images is essential for accessibility purposes. By adding descriptive alt text using the alt attribute, individuals who are unable to see the images can still comprehend their content and purpose. Screen readers then read aloud the alt text, enabling people with visual impairments to access visual content. It is important to make alt text concise, informative, and directly related to the image.

Use color with care: Color is a crucial element in web design, but it should not be relied upon solely for conveying information. It is important to provide additional means of understanding, especially when displaying error messages. Pairing color with explanatory text can help users comprehend the error. Moreover, it is essential to maintain a sufficient contrast between text and background to improve readability for individuals with low vision.
